		<h2>Formation as Saron Gas (1999-2001)</h2>
		<p>The band first formed in South Africa in 1999 under the name Saron Gas. Consisting of frontman vocalist and guitarist Shaun Morgan, bassist Dale Stewart, and drummer Dave Cohoe, the band released their first album, Fragile, in 2000 under Johannesburg-based
			independent record label Musketeer Records. Despite the region's focus primarily on pop and indigenous music, the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label Wind-Up Records, who signed them to a record deal to begin
			releasing music in North America. Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to sarin gas, and switched their name to Seether.</div>

		<h2>Disclaimer releases (2002-2004)</h2>
		<p>In 2002, Seether launched their first official album, Disclaimer, which earned the band three singles: "Fine Again", "Driven Under" and "Gasoline", in which only the first managed significant success. The year 2002 was very trendy for Seether. After
			the release of Disclaimer, the band toured constantly. Near the end of Disclaimer Tour, the band decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on world
			tour with Evanescence. "Fine Again" is also in the video games Madden NFL 2003 and 1080 Avalanche. Following the release of Disclaimer, the band toured continually in order to increase sales and name recognition. A planned second album was delayed
			for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an Evanescence worldwide tour. Seether reworked their acoustic ballad, "Broken", as an electric ballad with guest vocals by Amy Lee of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led
			the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled "Sold Me", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film, The Punisher, and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States,
			the United Kingdom and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time. Morgan has stated that the reworking of "Broken" was due to the wishes of the record company, rather than those of the band. An alternate version of the
			original album, with many of its songs remixed or rerecorded, was released in late 2004 and entitled Disclaimer II. The alternate version also featured eight extra tracks.</div>

		<h2>Karma and Effect (2005-2006)</h2>
		<p>The band's follow-up album, Karma and Effect, was released in 2005. Originally titled Catering to Cowards, the name was changed at the record label's demand. "Karma and Effect" debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 album charts, and was certified
			gold in the US and Canada. The album spawned three singles, "Remedy", "Truth" and "The Gift". "Remedy" reached number 1 on the US Mainstream Rock Charts, Seether's first number 1 hit. Seether released an acoustic CD/DVD set titled One Cold Night, recorded
			at Grape Street, in Philadelphia, on 22 February 2006. Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of "Needles" and "Burrito" from the album is
			due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities. Lead guitarist Patrick Callahan's departure from the band was announced in June 2006. No reason was given, but he apparently did not enjoy Seether's new material. Shaun Morgan commented: "Um...
			relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But
			when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him." Morgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was "dependence on a combination of substances" in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with Staind and Three Days Grace.</div>

		<h2>Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces (2007-2009)</h2>
		<p>Shaun Morgan, prior to the next album's debut, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was slated for an August release that was delayed until 23 October due to the suicide of Morgan's brother,
			Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured "Candice the Ghost", and was illustrated by David Ho. The first single, "Fake It", reached the top
			position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for WWE's No Way Out (2008). "Rise Above This", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and
			reached the No. 1 spot on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 2 on its mainstream counterpart. The final single from the album was "Breakdown", the video of which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original 23 October scheduled
			release date. Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces won Seether's first South African Music Award, in the category "Best Rock: English", as well as their first MTV Africa Music Award for "Best Alternative Artist".</p>
